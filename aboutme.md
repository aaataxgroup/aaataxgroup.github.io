title: About Me
subtitle: A brief description of me and my interests
---

My name is Shivani Kharva. I grew up in Anaheim, California, but I'd love to see more of the world. I've always had an interest in mathematics and the more technical side of the world, so my interest in web design and computer programming was not shocking to me.

Some fun facts about me:
* I love reading, writing, baking, and spending time with my friends and family.
* My family has a german shepherd named Sheru. His name means lion in Hindi because his fur looks like a lion.
* My love of learning new skills and concepts is what keeps me motivated.
