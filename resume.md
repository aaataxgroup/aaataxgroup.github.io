Hi! My name is Shivani Kharva and I am currently a 3rd year **Statistics and Data Science major at UCSB**. I am also part of the **Honor's Program** and have completed 
the undergraduate portion of UCSB's **Technology Management Program**. As I continue my studies, I would like to learn more about machine learning and communicating data 
to individuals who do not have a technical bakcground. I love math, baking, reading, art, playing video games, and going on nature walks.  

In the past couple of years at UCSB, my main extracurricular has been the **Data Science Club**. Currently, I act as the **Chair of Directors**, which allows me to 
work with executive board in collaborating with the PSTAT Department at UCSB about major club events (Fall Career Fair, Project Showcase, etc.) while also acting as a 
communication point between the executive board and the rest of the directors.

Furthermore, in Sumer 2022, I took on a role as a **Solutions Engineer Intern** at **HG Insights**. My daily tasks would revolve around completing Data-as-a-Service
requests using Microsoft SQL Server and communicating with Customer Succuess Managers to ensure that customer deliverables were up to company standard. Furthermore, I
also took part in the transition from HG Insight's product Platform v1.0 to their new Platform v2.0 by communicating discrepancies between the two user interfaces.

I hope you enjoy exploring this website and getting to know me a little more!
